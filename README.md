SOP stands for Statement of Purpose which is a necessary document for graduate applications. Basically explains why you are applying to that program/college.
LOR stands for Letter of Recommendation which is also a necessary document as a part of your application. It has letters from your professors/mentors/managers endorsing your application and supporting your candidature for the program.
